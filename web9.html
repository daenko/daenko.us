<h1>Internet Of Things</h1>
<h3>Smart things</h3>

<p>
<a href ="http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/the-internet-of-things">Internet of Things</a> - more objects are becoming embedded with sensors and gaining the ability to communicate. The resulting information networks promise to create new business models, improve business processes, and reduce costs and risks.  
It also brings a number of complex issues when thinking about the implementations. For example, what privacy and security implications come up when we make more and more parts of our lives connected to the Internet? More and more innovations are great and all, but how much of it do we actually need? Some of new things might not just be things we don't need, but they might also make things even more complicated than they need to be.

<p>Review  <a href ="http://postscapes.com/internet-of-things-examples/">Internet of Things - Examples</a>: it is great overview with lots of interesting examples in a broad range of categories.

        <div class="review"><p>Baby monitoring stuff really surprise me. I know similar ones but not so good as this one. Aimed at helping to prevent SIDS, the Mimo monitor is a new kind of infant monitor that provides parents with real-time information about their baby's breathing, skin temperature, body position, and activity level on their smartphones. It is not so easy to monitor a baby as an adult patient because they are active, sensitive and hard to control. <a href = "http://mimobaby.com/">Read more</a></p>

        <div class="review"><p>I was surprised to see this product and found it very interesting as you can save time and make your life easier when spending time in front of a mirror. You can get updates and information you need with just one click or though voice controls. The mirror simply connects to your wifi connection and works as an interactive screen. <a href = "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/860592058/imirror">Read more</a></p>

 I think this makes for an interesting concept. I also wonder what different diseases they would be able to detect earlier on. Right now, we have wearables or user-based things that monitor conditions like our heart-rate, how much we exercise per day, etc. but just how far can we go from there? <a href = "http://www.preventicesolutions.com/">Read more</a></p>

<div class="review_container">
        <div class="review"><p> This is a device with a smart alarm that analyzes one’s sleep cycle and gently wakes one up at the optimal time to start the day off right, and with sensors that monitor the environment and recognize the movement during sleep. With its reasonable price, useful functions, beautiful design and good reviews, Sense is really attractive to me because I think it will help to improve my sleep. <a href = "https://hello.is/">Read more</a></p>

 It checks and inform users about necessary amount of light, water and good PH level of the soil. One thing that interested me was a smart pot. The pot had a sensor for sunlight, temperature, soil moisture, and fertilizer level. With these sensors, the users can accurately track the plant grows. <a href = "http://postscapes.com/wireless-plant-sensors">Read more</a></p>

<h3>Critical Thinking, Problem Solving and Decision Making</h3>
   <p>There are many tools available on the web to help with problem solving skills development and practice. Review 2-3 articles from <a href ="http://wikieducator.org/User:Vtaylor/Learning_literacies/Links/Solve_it"> Solve it - media selections</a>. 
</p>
<p><a href ="http://skillspages.com/blog/?p=288"> Creativity and Critical Thinking – Part I</a>, <a href ="http://skillspages.com/blog/?p=295"> Part II</a>.  Critical thinking  is about new approaches, new ideas, new possibilities, "breaking out of the box". I like this article because it gives examples of critical thinking skills in different areas of life, for example business, sales, journalism, childcare, education, etc. It also gives the skills involved in building creativity.
