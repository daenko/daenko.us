<h1>Why Men and Women can't communicate</h1>
<img class="float_left img-responsive" src="img/esl6.png"/>
<p>Why do so many men refuse to ask for directions? Why do men and women have different assumptions about what to tell each other after they return home from work? Or about "trouble talking"? Deborah Tannen in her essay "Sex, Sights, and Conversation" maintains that they use language in different ways and these differences begin in their childhood.</p>

 <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12"> 
<h3>How boys and girls use their language</h3>
<p> Girls communicate in small groups or in pairs and they use language to build close intimasy relationships with friends. A girl needs to share her secrets and emotions with her best friend. Boys communicate in larger groups and use their language to negotiate status, to become higher in social hierarchy in a group of friends. These differences in early ages influence the way how men and women communicate when they become grown ups. 
<h3>Adulthood</h3>
<p>A woman and a man return home from work. Woman tends to share all her life's daily events with her partner, it means for her essence of intimacy, proof of healthy relationship. Man doesn't need to share all his feelings, he ignores details that is why he may answer "Nothing interesting" to the question "How was your day?" Since men regard talk as a means to negotiate status, they often see no need to talk at home. But they talk more in "public" situations with people they know less well. Also a man may avoid asking for direction because ignorance for him is positioning himself one-down to someone else, or even as a humiliation.</p>
<h3>Trouble talking</h3>
<p>The other kind of misunderstanding may occur in so called trouble talking. Women shares her problem with man. He immediately starts to solve it and to explain solution to her. Does she expect this reaction? No, maintains the author, she doesn't need a solution quickly. She needs to talk, to share all the details, to hear about his experience, to get emotional support, but not a solution.</p>

  <p class="m-b-0">Unaware of conversational style differences, we fall back on mutual blame: "You go on and on about nothing". "You don't listen to me."</p>  
</blockquote>
</div>
<h3>Opposite view</h3>
<p>A women is complaining about her boss. A man tries to understand boss's point of view and to explain it to the woman. He feels that offering an opposing view is a constructive conversational contribution. But woman may regard it as attack or lack of loyalty to her. Because conversation among women are characterized by mutual support, alternative views may be introduced as questions, but not as arguments. </p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p> In order to minimize conflict and improve relationships, men and women need to be aware of these "cross-cultural" differences in language use. Tannen's basic conclusion is that females use language to make connections and foster intimacy while males use language to preserve independence and negotiate status. Generalizing about groups of people make many of us nervous but ignoring patterns may tend to mutual blame and frustration.</p>
