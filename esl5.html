Is School Designed More for Girls Than Boys? </a><small>Michael Gonchar </small></figcaption>
</div>
<p>In the essay "Boys will be boys" Kantrowitz B. and Kalb C. mention the main differences in the emotional and social development of boys and girls. The authors focuses on challenges that boys face in conforming to traditional masculine roles. The image shows that the boys more likely than the girls may have attention deficit disorder that cause problems at school. What are the reasons and how to help both girls and boys at their adolescence?</p>
</div>
 <div class="row">
 <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12"> 
<h3>Early differences</h3>
<p> Because of difference in hormones, boys tend to be more aggressive and impulsive while girls are innately more able to control their emotions even when they are infants. Girls have vast capacity for establishing relationships and interpreting emotions. That is why they are well suited to school, they can easily "sit still and stay attentive". The first crisis point often comes for them in early adolescence while for boys it may come at 5, 6, 7. Why? One of the reasons of boys' frustration at these ages is problem with attention and behavior at school and the fact that the teachers like girls better. Another reason is connected to masculine stereotypes. </p>
<h3>The macho ideal still rules</h3>
<p>The authors mentioned that even as early as 4, the boys are already aware of the masculine stereotypes: a man is strong, independent, and never cries. There is a struggle - a desire and need for warmth from one hand and pull toward independence from the other. Individualization and disconnection from parents, especially mothers, is a basic part of growing up, but it is supposed to be for a teenager, not for a little boy. So there is connection between shuting down positive emotions at early ages and anger in adolescence. </p>

  <p class="m-b-0">"When boys repress normal feeling like love because of social pressure, they have lost contact is the genuine nature of who they are and what they feel. Boys are in silent crisis. The only time we notice it when they pull the trigger."</p>

</div>
<h3>Early adolescence</h3>
<p> A second crisis for boys and a first one for girls occurs around the same time at 11, 12, 13 years old. Many of girls experience depression; as many as 15% may perform suicide. The boys admire the culture of cruelty, drugs, alcohol, and aggressive behavior is a typical way of rebellion. </p>
<div class = "quote1">
<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote-reverse">
  <p class="m-b-0">"Anything tender, anything compassionate or too artistic is labeled gay. The homophobia of boys in the 11, 12, 13 range is stronger force than gravity."</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<h3>Feminist movement</h3>
<p>While girls have become freer in terms of gender roles, boys have become increasingly limited by traditional masculine stereotypes. Often boys suffer if they refuse to fit the mold. It is important to help boys to understand that they can be anything they want to be: sensitive, caring, creative, artistic.</p> 
<h3>To belong to</h3>
<p>Teenager boys want and need parents' attention no less then girls, but often just don't know how to ask for it. The important advice to parents is the following:  <i>with a boy especially you have to keep talking because they don't come and talk to you</i>. Another useful advice is to give them something positive to belong to because teenager guys want to belong to some group. Team sport is the best way <i>to channel your son's energy into constructive activities.</i> As a conclusion, author wrote: <b>"Boys will be boys, and we have to let them".</b> It means we have no choise but to accept their risky behavior and to make them feel safe and loved with us, parents. </p>
