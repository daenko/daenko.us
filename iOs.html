<h1>iOS Development</h1>
<img class = "profile" src="img/name2.png"/>
<p> The most valuable experience from taking this class was our teamwork. I'd never developed project in a team, so I needed to develop teamwork skills. First step was choosing 3 team members without knowing each other well enough. After that we had to choose what kind of app we were going to develop, and everybody had his own ideas. It was not easy to find a compromise. However, experience of negotiating and learning from each other has been very useful. We also needed to cooperate, and to combine our skills and abilities, so this experience has been also very helpful. As a result now I know that teamwork skills include emotional intelligence, adaptability, active listening, collaboration, conflict resolution, and compromise.</p>

<h3>First impression</h3>
<p>I took this class because it has been recommended to a web developer. I also wanted to understand the principles of apps development for mobiles. I didn't expect that this class would be the most complicated class I've ever had. For example, first program to display "Hello World!" takes 6 lines of code in C++, 1 line in Python and JavaScript. It takes about 30 pages in tutorial to explain how to make it in XCode - iOS Development tool, and it requires 3 files to keep all the necessary code. During our first lesson I couldn't make all the XCode settings.</p>
<p>Few weeks later I got used to XCode, and I had to come to lab every day for practise because I didn't have Mac at home. So this class has required large amount of time and high-effort thinking. Only 20 people from 40 have passed this class - this fact shows how really difficult it was!
</p>
<h3>Our App - Inquizitor </h3>
<p><b>Inquizitor</b> is an application similar to hangman game based on the Star Wars theme. The <i>Inquisitors</i> are the characters from the Star Wars who were hunting Jedi, so we changed  <i>inquisitor</i> to  <i>inquizitor</i> to show to a user that he or she will have some quiz on Star Wars theme. The primary purpose of the application is to understand how well you know Star Wars characters, planets, vehicles, etc. On the following pictures you can see our launch screen and list of themes. </p>
<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6">
   <img src="img/1.png" class="images img-responsive">

<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6">
   <img src="img/2.png" class="images img-responsive">
</div>
<div style ="clear:both"></div>
<p>There are multiple themes that the user can choose from.  Each theme contains an array of words that the application will choose randomly from and the user has to guess the correct word. All the words are chosen from the Star Wars. For example, in the Planets theme, all planetsâ€™ names are related to Star Wars (Alderaan, Coruscant, Tatooine, etc.)</p>
<p>After choosing the theme, the user has to choose a level: Level I, Level II, or Level III. The instructions for the levels as well as the difference between them are explained on our instruction page (Picture 3). The game starts on the page shown in the Picture 4 after the theme is selected. There is a prompt for the user to choose the level to start.</p>

<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6">
   <img src="img/3_0.png" class="images img-responsive">
</div>
<div style ="clear:both"></div>
<p>There are 3 levels at the bottom of this page. After choosing the level, the user has to pick a letter from the scroll view and click on the Pick It button. </p> 
<p>Level I gives a user five chances to guess the word. Each time the user takes a wrong guess, the space ship is attacked by meteors and a red labels with wrong letters and numbers of attempts left is appeared.  After the last wrong guess, the spaceship is destroyed.</p>

<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6">
   <img src="img/3_10.png" class="images img-responsive">
</div>
<div style ="clear:both"></div>
<div class="pic_name">
</div>
<p> At the Level II, the user will have 4 chances to guess the word. The animation is shown on the following pictures: the Jedi ship is attacked by t-fighters.</p> 
<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6">
   <img src="img/3_2.png" class="images img-responsive">
</div>
<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6">
   <img src="img/3_21.png" class="images img-responsive">
</div>
<div style ="clear:both"></div>
<p>
If the user fails to guess, the word becomes visible in the blank spaces. A user can switch between the levels any time he/she wants, the user may start one game and not finish it. That is why we decided to place all three level buttons on the same screen.</p> 
<p>The most complicated is Level III, in which user is limited by the time.  After the first wrong guess the user has 20 seconds to guess the right word. Otherwise, the space ship will go to a black hole and the game will end.

<p>However, despite all the difficulties our team of 3 girls without any previous experience in iOS, with little experience in programming (only one girl from our team had have programming experience before), with 1 Mac for all, has developed the project to show to the class. Our product was far from being perfect, but we showed the huge difference of knowledge before the class and after it. This class also taught me to overcome my fears and hardships, great life experience :)! </p>
