<h1>Rubric and site evaluation</h1>
<h3>Rubric</h3>
<img class = "float_left" src="img/name12.png" alt="rubric">
<p>
A rubric is a set of "rules" for an evaluation. By defining the criteria for ratings in advance, it is easier to provide objective feedback and a specific rating. Your rubric should include 4-5 characteristics and 3 levels to judge work - Needs work, Acceptable, Exceptional. Usually there is a score for each level for each criteria that is used to provide a score out of the possible total. Your rubric should include specific criteria for each area being assessed. </p>

   As per the rubric, the website scored a perfect 100. This is one example of a simple yet elegant website. It has a simple, effective layout where the theme of the product is very clear. The website displays consistency throughout by using the same fonts, color scheme and display style. It has a very convenient and easy navigation system. The graphics used are appropriate to the theme and of excellent quality. The hierarchy of content is what caught my eye. The first thing that you see when you visit the site is what the product does, how it works, services that it offers and then finally how you can sign up. Also, the overall quality of the website is striking due to the effective use of layout and design.<a href ="http://www.mint.com/">mint.com</a>

Just after showing that website evaluation can never be fully objective, I go on to try and evaluate a website objectively anyway. The website above implements parallax scrolling such that near-everything of the website is on one page and the user can scroll around that one page to read up about the website. There are a ton of parallax websites out there now, most of them jarring in my opinion, but I feel like this website does it quite well. The scrolling is very smooth and controlled and the content is set up to be scanned quickly as the user scrolls through. The graphics are very well done too. Not every website needs or can use parallax scrolling appropriately, but I think it fits the job very well for this website's purposes. <a href ="http://www.boy-coy.com/#apps">boy-coy.com</a>

As per the rubric, the website scored a 39 on 100. This website lacks many things and has a lot of room for improvement. The overall look and feel of the website is distracting and uninviting. There is too much information on the homepage and the navigation system is just confusing and very lengthy. The purpose and the theme of the site is somewhat vague. The structure and layout of the website is not consistent throughout and even on the homepage, the placement of images is just bizarre and random. There is no sense of design in placement of content on the homepage. The website also heavily lacks in creating a hierarchy of information and content that it is trying to provide and has a very poor user interface. <a href =" http://gatesnfences.com/">gatesnfences.com</a>

I would like to take this opportunity to bring up the topic of cultural differences in web design - because 'good' and 'bad' and 'terrifyingly painful' to us might be the complete opposite to someone else on the other side of the world. The link above talks about Japanese web design in particular, but these web design patterns are actually present in other places as well. The point here is, based on my rubric, I'd give all of the Japanese sites listed in the article an average score well below 70. Don't get me wrong, I aimed for my rubric to be objective for the most part and on top of that, I love Japan. Even so, Japanese web design is just not something my eyes can handle. This goes to show that evaluating websites can never truly be completely objective. <a href ="http://randomwire.com/why-japanese-web-design-is-so-different/"> randomwire.com</a>

Its pretty sad how this website is the ONLY website for an art center in this small town in Ohio. The layout is very confusing and painful to the eye. The colors are not pleasant -- there is too much contrast between the colors. The flow of the website is very poor --- I researched a little bit deeper about it and it seems that the website isn't even structures properly. We are trying to achieve in creating a dynamic site, not a static website. The website is just a collection of HTML webpages, linked together... Also I believe this site has a very poor security protection since it had been hacked before. Overall, the only + I can find in this website, is the navigation toolbar. Otherwise, I even noticed some misspellings and grammar mistakes.   6/15 <a href ="http://www.riversideartcenter.org/index.html">riversideartcenter.org</a>

This website scores 9 out of 20. It looks a bit chaotic especially with the irrelevant and distracting background images that change for every link you click. And the poor color choices make it hard to read some of the words, such as the contact information of Yale University School of Art on the top. In addition to the menu navigation, a few additional navigation bars are shown as “see also,” which could be at the top, in the middle, or at the bottom of a page. It’s hard to locate important information because the layout makes the content fragmentary. Vague navigation link names, such as “everything else” and “recent changes,” are confusing to the users. <a href ="http://art.yale.edu/"> yale.edu</a>

<h3>Web site development</h3>
<p>
Read the description of the <a href ="http://www.museumsandtheweb.com/mw2009/papers/jackson/jackson.html">site development</a> for the redesign of the <a href ="http://kids.tate.org.uk/">Tate Kids site</a>. What are some of the main issues for the client? How did the developer work with the client to address their concerns? How did they include interaction in the site? What were some of the important features of the new site? Write a brief summary highlighting ONE important thing you learned about professional web site development from this article. </p>  
<ul class="list">
<!------------------------------------------------------------->
<li>
<div class = "box">
It was very interesting to read about professional site development process. Before creating a content, the developers had provided 3 design options, and the users from target audience have chosen one option and some elements from others. It showed the process of design development.<button class="nav-toggle">Read more</button>
<div class="review_container">
        <div class="review">
The most interesting part to me is how did they include interaction in the site to promote kids-generated content. Their "My Gallery" application allows kids to upload their creative works as well as to use simple social networking features. As online safety is a key concern of the target audience, the social interactions and user-generated content have to be pre-moderated.  I like that My Gallery  has the additional navigation for better usability. So ONE important thing I learned about is that site development involves users from your target audience at all stages of process: planning, design, creating pages, developing navigation.
</div>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<!------------------------------------------------------------->
<li>
<div class = "box">Prior to the relaunch of Tate Kids, the old website was not created in a children-friendly manner, and did not meet the needs of all target audience, including 6 to 12-year-old kids, parents, and teachers. The undesirable, unspecific and confusing content failed to keep the web visitors.
<button class="nav-toggle">Read more</button>
<div class="review_container">
<div class="review">
<p>To “embody the Tate Kids ethos: smart, fun, irreverent, anarchic content with educational value,” the web developers held focus groups to understand the audience’s real needs, expectations, and patterns of internet use. In addition, the developers worked with the hired agency who provided design options and wire frames for prototyping and user testing.</p>

<p>To encourage interaction, the site includes many user-generated content, such as My Gallery, in which the users can create and upload their own art work, and save works created in some games. Moreover, with simple social networking features, users can add other users as ‘favorite artists’, add others' works to their gallery, rate the works, and send works by e-mail. In Tate tales, users can interpret art works by creating their own stories to each piece.</p>

<p>There are several features of the new site:<p>
<ul class ="list"><li>
    Customization: Users are allowed to choose their own backgrounds with Flesh elements from a range on the homepage</li>
    <li>Online Safety Guide: The guide was created as an ‘acrostic’ using TATE KIDS to make it appeal to the main audience.</li>
    <li>Art Sparks Films: This innovation mixed live action and animation, which focused on one work from the Tate Collection per episode.</li>
    <li>Off-line Crafts-based Activities: The resources encourage off-line activities for children and allow teachers to get involved.</li> 
    <li>e-Cards: A system that sends on-line postcards featuring works from the Tate Kids Collection to friends and family.</li>
    <li>Adult Zone: For parents, the safety fears are alleviated. For teachers, sample lesson plans were offered.</li>
<li>One thing I learn from the professional web site development is the importance of user testing during the process and a tight feedback loop between users, web developers, and web designers to make a project successful.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<!------------------------------------------------------------->
<li>
<div class = "box">I like how they wanted to appeal to the audience/users in terms of age and gender when it came to the design process. What was interesting is how they included some interaction within in the site to promote content for kids.<button class="nav-toggle">Read more</button>
<div class="review_container">
<div class="review"> The one thing I learn from this article is to understand the market. You need to figure out what kind of audience you want your website to be for in order for the site to do well.
</div>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<!------------------------------------------------------------->
<li>
<div class = "box">
It was interesting to learn how Tate completely revitalized their website and increased userability for all parties involved, including children, parents,  teachers.<button class="nav-toggle">Read more</button>
<div class="review_container">
<div class="review">  Meeting the needs of these three audienes proved to be an important aspect of success for Tate and an important thing I learned about professional web site development through their experience is that design development, though arduous, is crucial in order to understand what users expect out of a website. By designing 3 different design options and hosting focus groups where users test out different elements, this helped Tate have a better understanding of how to improve their content.
