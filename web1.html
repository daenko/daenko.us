<h1>1. Getting Started</h1>
<h3>Introductions and Expectations</h3>
<img class = "profile" src="img/name3.png" alt="search skills">
<p> What you need to know to work as a web developer? This is introduction to the class from one of a student:<p/>
<blockquote>
<p>HTML/CSS are pretty much an absolute; you don't need to know how make things super pretty with CSS, but being able to read HTML and understand what's going on is crucial. After that, ask yourself whether you want to be a front-end or back-end web developer: front-end developers work on looks (the face of the website i.e. the front) while back-end developers code how the website actually works behind the scenes. </p>
                <div class="btn btn-success btn-lg">
               <a href="#collapse1" class="btn-lg">Read more</a></div>            
<div id="collapse1" style="display:none">
<p>If you're going for front-end web development, your next step will be to learn JavaScript for the front-end. This will help make the websites you design more dynamic and well...prettier. That's part of your job - making things pretty. This will take a good amount of time so while you're learning it, it might also be good to learn more advanced CSS along with front-end CSS/JS frameworks and tools (Sass, Bootstrap, AngularJS to name a few). </p>
<p>If you're going for back-end web development, your next step would be to learn an actual back-end web development language. The popular ones are Python, PHP, JavaScript + NodeJS, and Ruby. While you'll need to eventually learn by building from scratch, it's better to learn a web framework that goes with the language as well so that you're spending more time coding/designing unique features versus repetitive features that have already been done and in some cases perfected. After that (or perhaps even during your learning of whatever language you choose), you'll need to learn a web database. I prefer any of the SQL variants out there (particularly MySQL or pgSQL) but MongoDB is also a popular database if you're not into learning SQL (which you should anyway).</p>
<p>Full-stack web developers are those who specialize in both the front and back ends of web development. You don't have to become equivalently specialized in both front and back end, but I recommend that if you choose one, become a little familiar with the other so you're not confused when it comes to plugging the two together to make a full-fledged website.</p>
<p>Aside from these, there are a lot of other skills that will come in handy no matter which side of the development spectrum you're on. To mention one of the bigger ones, learning to work with unix/linux systems are de facto standard for back-end developers but front-end developers will find learning it useful as well because many front-end tools are easier to work with on Mac/Linux systems as opposed to Windows systems.</p> 
<p>There are a ton of web developer jobs available out there right now, to my knowledge. Depending on whether you chose to specialize in front or back end, the jobs will differ. With that said, becoming a full-stack developer would therefore make you more marketable. In any case, front-end development jobs are generally a little less prevalent than back-end development jobs, in my experience, and often you'll end up working with both anyway. Again, the kinds of jobs out there will depend on whether they are front-end or back-end - front-end jobs will generally involve designing the look and feel of websites, with lots of emphasis on UX, while back-end jobs will involve coding the meat of the website, working with web databases and handling everything that goes on where the user is not looking.</p>
