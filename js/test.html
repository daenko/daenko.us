    <p>HTML/CSS are pretty much an absolute; you don't need to know how make things super pretty with CSS, but being able to read HTML and understand what's going on is crucial. After that, ask yourself whether you want to be a front-end or back-end web developer: front-end developers work on looks (the face of the website i.e. the front) while back-end developers code how the website actually works behind the scenes.

If you're going for front-end web development, your next step will be to learn JavaScript for the front-end. This will help make the websites you design more dynamic and well...prettier. That's part of your job - making things pretty. This will take a good amount of time so while you're learning it, it might also be good to learn more advanced CSS along with front-end CSS/JS frameworks and tools (Sass, Bootstrap, AngularJS to name a few). It doesn't matter which of these you learn, but the more you know, the more marketable you make yourself.</p>
