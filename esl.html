<h1>American Values</h1>
<img class = "profile" src="img/statue.jpg" class="img-responsive">
<p>It was the first chapter in the book for Advanced Reading Class, and it helps to understand some important things about Americans. These are individualism, privacy, informality, and achievement. I recommend you to read the <a href ="https://webshares.northseattle.edu/ralishio/American%20Values%20Article/American%20Values%20and%20Assumptions.pdf">full article</a>, it's very useful guide for foreigners. I'll show you my summary of the most interesting American values. </p>
</div>
 <div class="row">
 <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12">
<h3>Individualism</h3>
<p>
Author Gary Althen believes that kids from childhood are trained to consider themselves as individuals <b>responsible for their lives and decisions</b>. So there is no individualism without the responsibility. Small kids are taught to be responsible for their own money. To be responsible for young adults means to be independent from their family. That is why it is usual for them to pay their parents for room after college, if they can not afford separate accommodations. It is very strange to my culture because I know a lot of examples when parents save all their income to help their grown children.</p>
<p>We discussed the following negative side of individualism in our classroom. Old parents are customary live apart from their adult children in nursing home. But I was confused about the following fact: it is not always the choice of grown children, it is often <i>seniors'</i> choice to live in nursing home and to be independent from them, not to disturb them in their lives.</p>
<p>The best result of individualism is the <i>atmosphere of freedom</i>, as the author says, <i>where neither government not any other external force dictates what the individual does</i>. <!--In my country people are afraid of being responsible for their own lives and prefer to have a "good government" which is responsible for everything. Often people say that The President pays salaries to the working people and retirement benefits to the seniors. "If not He, then who else?" - the majority in my country think.-->  </p>
<p>The strongest skill that kids learn at American schools is critical thinking because they believe there is no individualism and freedom without it. In American culture you are encouraged to think independently, to express your own opinion, to stand out from the crowd. </p>

</div>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>It means that every person needs some time to be alone, <i>"to think about things or recover their spent energy"</i>. Interesting that Americans don't understand people who don't like to spend some time alone, and consider them weak or dependent</i>. Privacy means boundaries that other people are not supposed to cross.</p>
<p>
In the other interesting article <i>"Friends and Strangers"</i> the author M. Nydell writes that <i>there is no concept of privacy among Arabs, and the synonym of privacy for them is "loneliness".</i> The author mentions that western people may feel uncomfortable among the Arabian friends because of <i>frequent contacts and lack of privacy</i>. In my culture the concept of privacy started to exist only after the collapse of the Soviet Union, so it is not enough time to form true respect to personal space.
</p>
<h3>"Hi, how are you?"</h3>
<p>
In America even stranger on a trail in a forest may ask you: "Hello, how are you?". This is the first thing that seems strange to any foreigner in America: we can hear these words many times a day from strangers and especially from store clerks. Actually he or she does not has special interest in you, then what does "How are you?" mean in American culture?  Is it just politeness? The author believes that this is the part of informal and equal relationships among people. You may be rich, a cashier may be poor but it doesn't matter. You show each other that you are simple, <i>"regular guys", part of a group of normal, pleasant people. "All men are created equal".</i> The other great American value is informality.
</p>
<h3>Informality</h3>
<p>
There are two examples of informal behavior from my point of view. The first one is informal dress code and it is mentioned in this article. The author gives the example of <i>college's president, dressed in shorts and old T-shirt</i>. His "dress code" tells: <i>"I'm just like anyone else. I don't think that I'm too good for you."</i>
</p>
<p>
The second example of informal behavior is calling each other by first names without <i>"special deference for age or position"</i>. You call professor at the college "Joe" or "Mary". It was mentioned in the other interesting article: "Polite but Thirsty" by Yaping Tang. It is about an experience of a young Chinese student when she first visited US for her study. According to Chinese traditions you have to refuse an offer for several times even if you really want it. It is the element of their politeness. So she was terrible thirsty but refused her professor's offer to have something to drink.
</p>
<h3>The future and progress</h3>
<p>
The Americans believe that they can control the future or at least can influence it. They are less considered about the past because <i>new things are better than old things</i>. One of the main American assumption is that their <i>"environment is subject to human domination and control"</i>. The word fatalism has the negative meaning for Americans unlike other cultures where the future is considered to be in the hands of God or powerful people.
</p>
<h3>Time and punctuality</h3>
<p>
Time for Americans is not something around them, but it is a <b>resource</b> to use wisely every day. They pay attention to <i>time management</i> to increase efficiency, I can't find similar concept in my culture.
</p>
<p>
Americans place a premium on punctuality. Punctuality in America means you can not be late even for a  minute because you waste people's time. Here is example of my own: I was late on my second English class for 5 minutes. When I came, all the students had to finish our first quiz. So I missed a quiz because of being 5 minutes late!
</p>
<p>There was another interesting article "Time Talks, with an Accent" by Robert Levine. We've learnt about American professor who came for work to a university in Brazil and has been <i>"repeatedly bewildered, frustrated, fascinated"</i> by Brazilian's attitude towards time and punctuality. He was obsessed by Brazilian students being lated on an hour or more, clocks at the offices showing wrong time, his department head, who wasted time during their appointment. He couldn't believe that there could be no punctuality at all, that everybody was relaxing and not hurrying.</p>
<h3>Directness and assertiveness</h3>
<p>They appreciate directness in communication, business, relationship. I wasn't sure what does the word <i>assertiveness</i> mean. It is about expressing feelings and requests directly and openly. For example, if I dislike something you are doing, I will tell you how I feel directly and personally. There are even "assertiveness-training classes" to teach a person how to express himself in a forthright manner.</p>
<h3>Non-verbal communication</h3>
<p>We've read another article "Where do we stand?" by Lisa Davis. She focuses on cross-cultural differences in the use of personal space and the conflicts that often arise from these differences. Americans need more personal space then Arabian do, social conversatians for Arabians include touching and very close distance as part of building relationship. Japanese people avoid eye contact, touching, and hands shaking, while Spanish friends hug and kiss each other as greeting. People should learn nonverbal traditions of other cultures to avoid intercultural problems. </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
We all are different because we are from different cultures, and many social habits are ingrained in our lifestyle. However we have to adjust to the environment we live in if we want to integrate to other culture. As for me, I didn't experience a painful social vulnerability when coming to the USA, but I had some difficulties with language, driving, new food, new school rules for my kids. Still I think that my adaption to the new environment was very important life experience because as a result I became more observing, more flexible, more curious about other people traditions and their values.
