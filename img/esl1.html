<h1>Why school is bad for children?</h1>
<img class = "float_left" src="img/wall.jpg">
<p>This is the <a href =http://www.naturalchild.org/john_holt/school_is_bad.html">original article</a> published in 1969. The author John Holt argues that <b>formal</b> education damages students by converting their natural curiosity, energy, confidence, and creativity into <b>passiveness, indifference, and low self-esteem</b>. He maintains that school should be fundamentally changed to learn the students to evaluate their own work, to encourage <b>active learning</b> and <b>interaction</b> with real world.

<h3>Holt's major criticism of schools:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>children feel that learning is a <b>passive process</b></li>
    <li>schools discourage creativity, originality, and curiosity</li>
     <li>they teach students that "to be wrong, uncertain, confused, is a crime"</li>
     <li>at school children can't interact with other children in the manner they want</li>
     <li>children are assigned a role, school neglects their needs and differences</li>
<li>they provide little opportunity for students to learn about the real world.</li>      
</ul>

<h3>Holt's major recommendations for improving schools:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>abolish or modify compulsory school attendance</li>
    <li>take students into the community to learn about the real world, provide libraries, sports halls, music studios for them</li>
     <li>bring more of the real world into schools, including people from different professions</li>
     <li>encourage students to work together and to learn from each others</li>
     <li>abolish tests, to let them judge their own work</li>
     <li>abolish fixed curriculum because it is useless in the rapidly changeable world.</li>
</ul>
<div style ="clear:both"></div>
<p>The author did his research about 50 years ago, but his results are still applicable today. I think that schools in America became more creative and more "kids-friendly" but still the problems of "passive learning" and "students' interactions" remain nowadays. I'd like to emphasize 3 key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one is <b>active learning</b>. As for me, true active learning came to me far after I had became 30. The process of active learning is much more creative, exciting, and productive because <b>you </b> choose what to learn, how to learn, and why do you need it.</li>
<li> I think that <b>evaluation of your own work</b> is very important part of education because it makes you responsible for your results and enhance active learning. It is also important for self-esteem and self-reliance. </li>
<li>I have never thought about <b>resourceful</b> as one of the main characteristics of student. It means not only to be clever in dealing with problems, but also being able to turn to somebody for help. Actually resourcefulness is one of the main ideas of both education and problem solving in our whole life.</li></u>
